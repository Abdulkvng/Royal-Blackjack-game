## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of Blackjack. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 points as possible without going over. You can play this game directly on the website linked above.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: The player’s goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, without exceeding 21.
2. **Card Values**:
   - Number cards (2–10): Face value
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points
   - Aces: Worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable for the player
3. **Gameplay**:
   - The player and dealer both receive two cards.
   - The player can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).
   - The dealer reveals their hand after the player stands.
   - The dealer must hit if their hand is below 17 and stand otherwise.
   - The winner is determined based on the hand values, with 21 being the highest.
